# RepairPlus

RepairPlus brings forth a new frontier to the Minecraft anvil. Using RepairPlus, toBeRepaired will now be able to left-click anvils and repair items at the cost of EXP or in-game Economy balance. It also allows you to give anvils Unbreaking so that they will never break, which is extremely useful for an anvil at spawn! Have questions?
