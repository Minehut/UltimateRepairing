Hey loves,

Thanks for downloading our plugin ^_^ In order to 
run it you will need a plugin called arconix. It
basically takes a bunch of methods that we use all
over the place throughout our plugin lineup and 
stores it in one place so we don't have to write 
new code every time we need to get something simple 
done. So make sure to stay up to date with the latest
updates for it.

If you need help you can always join our
discord in which is listed at the bottom of all of 
our plugin pages.

Enjoy <3 
Brianna & The Songoda Team.
